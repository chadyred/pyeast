# East Oriented Programing

## TL;DR

> All is about messaging.

# Basics in east

A try with East Programing with many examples with python. We have to keep in mind messaging keep object:

* be able to do everything with abilities allow through interface;
* return themeself;
* give themeself to other function which have capabilities by implementing behaviour through interface;
* stay idempotent by using data through messaging.

# Why example ?

Many sample to show :

* how object are small;
* how coordinate amount of object;
* how keep data struct sync with object information on messaging.
